# from an unprofiled Xcode could not compile an asset catalog or a storyboard: refuse it here, before anything is built.

#   0  the build has a profile

xcode-tools: Xcode build $build has no asset/storyboard tools profile (measured: ${known:-none}).
An image made from it could not compile asset catalogs or storyboards, so no image chain is built.
Measure that Xcode's actool, ibtool and copypng black-box (DEVELOPER_DIR selects the Xcode), then add an
XcodeToolsProfile entry (Sources/XlessCore/XcodeToolsProfile.swift) with the measured values:
  DEVELOPER_DIR=<Xcode.app>/Contents/Developer scripts/assetkit-golden.sh
  DEVELOPER_DIR=<Xcode.app>/Contents/Developer scripts/ib-golden.sh
