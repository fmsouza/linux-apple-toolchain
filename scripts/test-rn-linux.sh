#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Builds samples/HelloRN on Linux (in the xless-rn image) with its committed overlay through prepare, build, assets and
# finalize, unsigned, and compares the app and its app extension with samples/HelloRN/reference/reference.json and
# reference-appex.json (recorded from xcodebuild on a Mac by `make rn-reference`): the build stage's app as it is, the
# finalized app with the one key the overlay adds (ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption, from usesNonExemptEncryption: false).
# No allowed gaps: any other difference fails. Exits non-zero on a difference or a failed stage.
# On a Mac host, the asset catalogs are compared too: the built and finalized apps' .car files are copied out of the
# volume and `xless tauri compare --assets-only` (host build) reads them and the reference's recorded catalogs with
# `xcrun assetutil --info`: per rendition Name, Idiom, Scale, Appearance, Opaque, Encoding, Colorspace, pixel size,
# bits per component, color components (not compression, sizes or digests). The one known AssetKit gap (no MultiSized
# Image rendition for the app icon, docs/research/parity-known-gaps.md) is in samples/HelloRN/reference/allowed-gaps.txt,
# which lists `car:` keys only. The pod's catalog has a transparent image and a colorset, so opacity and colors are
# covered. Elsewhere this step is skipped (no assetutil).
#   make test-rn-linux
#   scripts/test-rn-linux.sh [--keep]
# Two runs:
#   1. From a fresh prepare: the work copy is deleted first (--keep skips that), so the JS install, `expo prebuild`,
#      `bundle install`, `pod install` and a clean Swift Build all run. Needs network (npm, gems, CocoaPods specs and pods).
#   2. Again with `--network none`: prepare finds the native project up to date (no prebuild, no pod install) and the
#      build runs offline, incrementally. This is the regression of Task 7's offline workspace build, now through
#      `xless ship` instead of a hand-run script (scripts/spikes/rn-workspace-linux.sh, removed).
# Both compare. Also checked: every Mach-O image's LINKEDIT tables are aligned as dyld requires (`xless inspect`),
# main.jsbundle is Hermes bytecode, Assets.car holds the local pod's image (compiled by CocoaPods' Copy Pods Resources
# phase through `xcrun actool`), both bundles carry the overlay's bundle IDs and the build number, and the build wrote
# entitlements.json and packages.json (what the sign step reads).
# No signing, no App Store Connect: the build number is explicit (XLESS_BUILD_NUMBER), so no dated-build lookup happens.
# 3. A simulator build of the same work copy (`--destination simulator`, offline), next to the device build: it must be an
#    arm64 iphonesimulator app, signed ad hoc, each executable carrying its simulated entitlements, and it must leave the
#    device build's outputs alone (its app, entitlements.json, packages.json, sdk.json, build-number and derived data).
# 4. The device build again, offline, after the simulator build: it must still match the reference (the work copy's
#    node_modules, where some packages cache build outputs, is shared by both).
# On a Mac host, scripts/sim-launch.sh then installs and launches the simulator app on an iOS Simulator and checks that
# it is still running after 10 s (its screenshot, console and any crash report are kept in ~/.cache/xless/sim/HelloRN);
# elsewhere that step is skipped. --no-launch skips it on a Mac too.
# Variables: ARCH (arm64 or amd64; default the host's: the image's platform, so ARCH=amd64 on an arm64 Mac runs the amd64 chain
#   under emulation), XLESS_IMAGE (default xless-rn:local-<arch>), DOCKER_CONTEXT (default colima-xless if it exists),
#   XLESS_RN_TEST_VOLUME (default xless-rn-test-work): the docker volume holding the work copy and the pnpm store.
#   XLESS_RN_OVERLAY (default samples/HelloRN/xless.overlay.yml): the overlay, relative to the repository; its work copy is
#     named after the file. XLESS_RN_REFERENCE (default samples/HelloRN/reference): the Mac reference directory (an absolute
#     host path; mounted read-only). With the Xcode 26.2 pin: XLESS_IMAGE=xless-rn:local-arm64-xcode26.2
#     XLESS_RN_OVERLAY=samples/HelloRN/xless.overlay-26.2.yml XLESS_RN_REFERENCE=<`DEVELOPER_DIR=<26.2> make rn-reference`'s OUT>
#     XLESS_RN_TEST_VOLUME=xless-rn-test-work-26.2 (the reference's directory also needs the allowed-gaps.txt of the default one).
# The repository is mounted read-only. Caches are the docker volumes scripts/testflight.sh uses: xless-corepack,
# xless-bundle, xless-cocoapods-home, xless-cocoapods-cache (created on first use).
