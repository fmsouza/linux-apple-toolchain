# Ruling R10: the Swift toolchain an Xcode's image chain compiles app code with. Reads Apple's Swift for the Xcode build
# from versions.env's table (XCODE_APPLE_SWIFT_<build>, measured once on the maintainer's Mac; nothing is executed),
# looks the build up in the map (XCODE_SWIFT_<build>), checks the entry against the map's rule (same major.minor as
# Apple's Swift, patch not above it), and prints the make variables for docker/Dockerfile.sdk, one per line:
#   APP_SWIFT_VERSION=<x.y.z>            (empty when it is versions.env's SWIFT_VERSION: the image's own Swift)
#   APP_SWIFT_URL_AARCH64=… APP_SWIFT_SHA256_AARCH64=… APP_SWIFT_URL_X86_64=… APP_SWIFT_SHA256_X86_64=…
# Refuses (exit 2) an Xcode without an entry, an entry that breaks the rule, and a release without pinned downloads.
# Usage: scripts/xcode-swift.sh <Xcode build>       (scripts/build-images.sh runs it)
#   VERSIONS_ENV: the versions file (default: the repository's versions.env).
