# Installs a release from its assets before they are published, as a user would, and checks the version it reports:
#   scripts/verify-release.sh <version> <dist>
# <dist> holds the assets scripts/release-assets.sh made (the tarballs, SHA256SUMS, install.sh). They are laid out the way
# a GitHub release serves them, <dir>/download/v<version>/ and <dir>/latest/download/, and <dist>/install.sh installs from
# there (XLESS_RELEASE_BASE=file://<dir>) twice, into fresh prefixes: once pinned to <version> (XLESS_VERSION) and once
# as the latest. Each time `xless --version` and share/xless/VERSION must be <version>. The tarball installed is this
# machine's architecture (XLESS_UNAME_M / XLESS_UNAME_S pass through to install.sh, for tests).
